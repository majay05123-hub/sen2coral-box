<h3>Radiometric Normalisation</h3>

<p>
    Radiometric normalisation assumes that imagery data contains identifiable target that are consistent
    throughout the time series and which are spectrally stable over time. The use of these pseudoinvariant
    features (PIF) corresponding to optically bright (sand) or optically dark (seagrass) targets,
    deep pelagic waters, human-made infrastructures (roofs, roads, airstrips) might be used to intercalibrate
    two different images.
</p>


<p>
    With respect to application to Sentinel 2 MSI data no special modifications of the normalisation
    methods are required, except to note that for normalising Band 1 with 60 m pixels relatively large
    reference features will be required. However, our proposed processing chain does not rely on
    spectral data after this processing step (Figure 5) so the quality of the Band 1 normalisation is not
    limiting. Basically, within Sen2Coral radiometric normalisation is implemented assuming an imagery
    as reference and by normalising the other images with respect to the reference.
</p>

<p>
    A step by step outline of the procedure is:
<ul>
    <li>Selection of PIFs</li>
    <li>Univariate regression between linear relationships for Sentinel-2 bands across time using
        polygons located in PIFs</li>
    <li>Linear transformation of the images with respect to reference</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h4>Radiometric Normalisation implementation in SNAP</h4>
<p>
    The Radiometric Normalisation algorithm has been implemented into SNAP with the following features:
<ul>
    <li>Support of multiband and multi-size products. </li>
</ul>
